## XSS check
The `code` is under testing for bugs!

Please read the Java code that you forked from my repository and try to find the XSS bug in the code keep in mind it's a working code, but as a hint; think of the values hierarchy and how and when it's stored.

Time deadline by Sunday the 16th at 1 pm.
The main idea of this task not to find the whole thing, rather than learning how to approach this OWASP bug. Please submit your work on your GitHub.

The main tasks:
1- Discover the bug.
2 - Try to solve it & give me the steps to do that.
3 - Recommend the best approach, and why? (Advance)
